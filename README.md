TipOfTheDay-AspNet6

This is a prototype of an ASP.NET Core MVC web site for crowd sourcing and sharing programming tips.
The point of this prototype was to test the many-to-many Tip to Tag relationship in the domain model. This is tested with simple web pages that allow creating Tips and Tags and putting Tags on Tips.

There are UML and ERD diagrams in the docs directory.
